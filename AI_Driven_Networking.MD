We meet people, and make friends or colleagues or lovers, and we often say, it was such good luck that we met given this and that. The world today runs on luck. What if it didn't?

## Intelligent Networking

You input all your information, or better yet, the AI passively watches you and learns about you. You have lots of needs:
 * Someone to mow the lawn
 * A business partner also interested in AI driven social networks
 * Friends who share your hobbies

You could imagine a network that always has a list of what you HAVE, and what you WANT.

The network looks at everything, and everyone else, and recommends you people to talk to, based on it finding a high mutual interest. You may even have a secret project
that you have no desire to advertise, no energy to advertise, but this network goes out and finds people who would be a good fit for your side project.

It's very PUSH driven. You don't go searching, you don't go placing ads, the AI decides all these things, and thus, unlike every other network, it isn't dominated by
the people who are most noisy, it isn't only alive when people are posting to it, it does a GREAT job at matching, so people pay attention to the results.

I truly believe that the realization of such a network will be a key milestone in the singularity that will optimize.

## It will replace advertising
When adverts are now things you definitely want, they aren't adverts, they are wanted useful information. It's like, ads are getting more targeted, to the point
of being useful. This just takes the concept even further, and beyond goods.
